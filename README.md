## Smart Parking is a type of parking solution that will incorporate cameras, counting sensors, or in-ground Smart Parking sensors with a raspberry pi kit.

## These gadgets are typically placed adjacent to or implanted into parking spaces to determine if they are empty or occupied.

## These sensors will directly detect the useful information to the user side mobile application.

## As a result of which, they can easily find and reserve a parking slot.

## To complete this purpose, we are planning to do the following things:

##	One stand-up in a day every morning to assign and assess the tasks given to the members.

##	Rectifying errors and updating the project gradually

##	The tasks will be given to members individually to complete in a day or two depending upon the task.
